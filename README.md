Spring Boot API

This project implements a RESTful API using Spring Boot, focused on managing categories and products with full CRUD operations and a one-to-many relationship between them. Key features include:

Category & Product CRUD Operations: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting categories and products.

Spring Boot & JPA/Hibernate: Built with Spring Boot, using annotation-based configuration (no XML) and JPA/Hibernate for database interactions.

RDB Configuration: Configured with a relational database for persistent storage.

Server-Side Pagination: Supports pagination on the server side for optimized data handling.

Relationship Management: One-to-many relationship between categories and products.


Endpoints follow REST principles and include server-side pagination for efficient data retrieval.
